## Re-submission note

- Pls explain CCDr, and provide a DOI for the reference.

Pls write these as

   Authors (year) <DOI:.....>

(with no space after 'DOI:').

The description has been updated with a more detailed description of the CCDr algorithm, and the citation has been removed entirely.

- Again, we would prefer if you explained the acronym, and ideally
provided a reference with a DOI.  I see that this is

  Concave penalized Coordinate Descent with reparametrization (CCDr)

and the reference has URL
<http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/aragam15a.html>: if you cannot find a
DOI, then pls use the URL.

URL has been added (no DOI available) and acronym is now explained.
